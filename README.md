Overview

This Python script demonstrates basic list operations including appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding the index of an element. It provides a simple example of how to manipulate lists in Python.
Steps Performed

1. Create an empty list called `my_list`.
2.Append elements `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40` to the list.
3.Insert the value `15` at the second position (index `1`).
4.Extend the list with another list: `[50, 60, 70]`.
5.Remove the last element from the list.
6.Sortthe list in ascending order.
7.Find and print** the index of the value `30` in the list.

Expected Output

After executing the script, the final state of the list and the index of `30` will be:


my_list: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
Index of 30: 3


 Usage

Run the script using Python 3:
bash
python script.py
